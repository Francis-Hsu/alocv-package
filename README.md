# Approximate Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

This repository contains packages which implement the approximate leave-one-out
cross validation strategy for common regressors in an efficient way. For reference
and specific formula, see:

[Approximate Leave-One-Out for High-Dimensional Non-Differentiable Learning Problems: Shuaiwen Wang, Wenda Zhou, Arian Maleki, Haiho Lu, Vahab Mirrokni](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.0271).

The core code is written in C, and is integrated into different languages
using their respective packaging systems.
